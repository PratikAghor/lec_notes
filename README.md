# lecture notes that I wished were available somewhere, also some useful notes I jotted down.

#### Pratik Aghor


1. Topology and Geometry by Dr Tadashi Tokieda (T^2): A set of inspiring lectures by Prof Tadashi Tokieda on itroduction to topology. The lecture notes are mostly accurate (some of my solutions might be wrong, but the solutions were written during the lectures. I would be happy to add addendums/corrections if someone finds errors.) 

2. Group theory and ring theory factoids from 'Abstract Algebra' by Dummit and Foote and `Groups and Symmetry' by M. A. Armstrong. 

3. Fluid Dynamics: Some problems on the fundamentals of fluid dynamics, Stokes flow (low Reynolds)

4. Pattern formation: Homework problems from pattern formation course

5. FreeFem++ lecture notes I contributed to that were used as tutorials in CIMPA 2015 IIT-Bombay summer school
