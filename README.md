# lecture notes that I wished were available somewhere

#### Pratik Aghor


1. Topology and Geometry by Dr Tadashi Tokieda (T^2): A set of inspiring lectures by Prof Tadashi Tokieda on itroduction to topology. The lecture notes are mostly accurate (some of my solutions might be wrong, but the solutions were written during the lectures. I would be happy to add addendums/corrections if someone finds errors.)
